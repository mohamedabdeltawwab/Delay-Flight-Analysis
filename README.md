# ✈️ Delay Flight Analysis Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes **flight delay patterns** using real-world flight data.  
The analysis was performed using **Power BI** to uncover insights about airline performance, delay categories, and factors affecting total delay time.

The dashboard helps stakeholders identify **which airlines, routes, or months experience the most delays**, and provides **recommendations** to improve operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction.

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Understand flight delay patterns by airline, month, and route.  
- Identify top-performing airlines and those with higher delay times.  
- Highlight potential causes for flight delays.  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for improvement.

## 🧮 KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
- **Total Count of Airlines:** 10  
- **Average Flight Distance:** 972 KM  
- **Total Number of Flights:** 240  
- **Most Frequent Delay Category:** Minor (43.75%)  
- **Top 5 Airlines by Flight Distance:** Saudia, Qatar Airways, Gulf Air, Royal Jordanian, Kuwait Airways  
- **Least 5 Airlines by Flight Distance:** FlyDubai, Oman Air, Emirates, EgyptAir, Etihad  

---

## 📈 Dashboard Insights
- **Saudia** and **Qatar Airways** operate the most flights and have the longest flight distances.  
- **Dubai** is the top origin city with the highest number of departures and delay minutes.  
- **Fridays** have the highest total delay minutes across the week.  
- **January** records the most total delay minutes, while **April** has the least.  
- Most delays fall into **minor or moderate categories**, indicating manageable causes rather than major disruptions.

---

## 🔍 Possible Causes of Delay
- **Weather disruptions** during winter months (January and February).  
- **High traffic at major hubs** like Dubai and Doha.  
- **Operational inefficiencies** in airlines with frequent short-haul routes.  
- **Peak travel days** (Fridays and Sundays) leading to congestion and scheduling pressure.

---

## 💡 Recommendations
1. **Optimize scheduling** during high-delay months (Jan–Feb).  
2. **Improve turnaround efficiency** at top delayed origins (Dubai, Doha).  
3. **Enhance crew and maintenance planning** for peak days (Friday–Sunday).  
4. **Use predictive analytics** to anticipate delay risks.

## 🧰 Process Summary
1. **Data Upload:** Imported dataset into **Power Query** for cleaning and transformation.  
2. **Data Understanding:** Explored structure and columns — identified data types and missing values.  
3. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Converted column data types (e.g., Date, Distance, Delay Minutes).  
   - Removed duplicates and handled nulls.  
4. **Visualization:** Built Power BI dashboard for:  
   - Flight count by airline, month, and origin.  
   - Total delay minutes by airline, day, and destination.  
   - Delay category breakdown (Minor, Moderate, On Time, Severe).
